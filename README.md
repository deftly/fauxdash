# fauxdash

This is because I got tired of writing the same kinds of things over and didn't want the full lodash. It's amazing how simple some things are when you know you're running Node and don't care about 87 flavors ES/browser vendor mash-up, right?

Also this is probably terrible and only intended for use by my other projects. Note its total lack of documentation. That's on purpose.
